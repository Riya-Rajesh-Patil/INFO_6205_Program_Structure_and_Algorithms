    "**Problem Statement**\n",
    "In the context of Hopfield Neural Networks, define and discuss the characteristics that determine whether a given state of the network can be considered an \"attractor.\" Describe how these attractors contribute to the network's ability to recall patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input Format:** A description of a state in a Hopfield Neural Network. This description should include the values of neurons in the network.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Format:** A detailed explanation assessing whether the given state is an attractor, based on the principles governing Hopfield Networks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Inputs and Outputs**  \n",
    "- **Sample Input:** A state of a Hopfield Network with 4 neurons: `[1, -1, 1, -1]`.\n",
    "- **Sample Output:** \"This state is an attractor because it satisfies the energy minimization principle of Hopfield Networks, leading to stable, minimal energy configuration.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sample Input:** A state of a Hopfield Network with 3 neurons: `[0, 1, -1]`.\n",
    "- **Sample Output:** \"This state is not an attractor as it does not correspond to a stable, low-energy configuration in the network.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints**  \n",
    "- The number of neurons (`N`) in the network should be a positive integer, typically `N > 2` to allow for meaningful pattern dynamics.\n",
    "- Neuron values should be binary or bipolar (i.e., 1 and -1 for bipolar representation).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**  \n",
    "To solve the proposed problem about attractors in Hopfield Neural Networks, we need to understand the concept of attractors and how to determine whether a given state in a Hopfield network is an attractor. An attractor in the context of Hopfield networks is a stable state that the network will converge to from a set of initial states. These attractors represent stored patterns or memories in the network.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A state in a Hopfield Network is considered an attractor if it is a point of local minimum in the network's energy landscape. The energy of a state in a Hopfield Network is given by the equation:  \n",
    "\n",
    "E = -(1/2)∑(i=!j).w_i_j.s_i.s_j\n",
    "\n",
    "where s_i and s_j are the states of neurons \\( i \\) and \\( j \\), and \\( w_{ij} \\) is the weight of the connection between these neurons.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A state is an attractor if a small perturbation (like flipping the state of a single neuron) does not lead to a significant change in the overall state of the network. In other words, the network will eventually settle back into this state or a very similar one.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Pseudocode**\n",
    "To check if a given state is an attractor:\n",
    "\n",
    "function isAttractor(network_state, weights_matrix):\n",
    "    for each neuron i in network_state:\n",
    "        test_state = flip the state of neuron i in network_state\n",
    "        if energy(test_state, weights_matrix) < energy(network_state, weights_matrix):\n",
    "            return False\n",
    "    return True  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof of Correctness**  \n",
    "The correctness of this solution is based on the fundamental principles of Hopfield Networks. An attractor, being a stable state, should have lower energy than its neighboring states. By iterating over each neuron and flipping its state, we simulate a small perturbation. If the energy of the network with any flipped neuron is lower than the original state, the original state is not at a minimum energy point, and thus not an attractor.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is grounded in the energy minimization principle of Hopfield Networks, which states that the network evolves towards states of minimum energy. The Python code effectively calculates and compares these energy states, providing a practical way to determine if a given state is an attractor."

    "In a virtual gardening game, players plant seeds to grow various types of flowers. There are `k` different types of flowers. Each time a player plants a seed, it randomly grows into one of the `k` types of flowers with equal probability. The objective is to determine how many seeds a player needs to plant on average before they can expect to have at least one of each type of flower in their garden.\n",

    "**Input Format:** A single integer `k`, representing the number of different types of flowers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Format:** A single integer, representing the average number of seeds that need to be planted to expect at least one of each type of flower.  \n",

    "- **Sample Input 1:** `3`\n",
    "- **Sample Output 1:** `5.5`\n",
    "- **Explanation:** On average, a player needs to plant approximately 5.5 seeds to have at least one of each of the 3 types of flowers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sample Input 2:** `5`\n",
    "- **Sample Output 2:** `11.41`\n",

    "**Constraints**  \n",
    "`1 <= k <= 50`. This constraint ensures the problem remains computationally manageable and realistic within the context of a game.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** \n",
    "To solve this problem, we can apply the principles of the \"Coupon Collector's Problem,\" a well-known concept in probability theory. The problem essentially asks for the expected number of trials (in this case, planting seeds) to collect all `k` different types of items (flowers).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pseudocode**\n",
    "Here's a pseudocode for calculating the expected number of seeds to plant:\n",
    "\n",
    "function expectedNumberOfSeeds(k):\n",
    "    expected_seeds = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "    for i from 1 to k:\n",
    "        probability_of_new_flower = 1 - (i - 1) / k\n",
    "        expected_seeds += 1 / probability_of_new_flower\n",
    "\n",
    "    return expected_seeds\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**\n",
    "1. **Initialization:** We initialize `expected_seeds` to 0. This variable will accumulate the expected number of seeds needed to get each new type of flower.\n",
    "2. **Iteration:** We loop through each type of flower from 1 to `k`.\n",
    "3. **Probability Calculation:** For each iteration, we calculate the probability of planting a new type of flower that we don't already have. This is done by `1 - (i - 1) / k`, where `(i - 1) / k` is the probability of planting a type we already have, and `1 - (i - 1) / k` is the probability of getting a new type.\n",
    "4. **Accumulating Expected Seeds:** We add the inverse of this probability to our `expected_seeds`. The inverse (`1 / probability_of_new_flower`) represents the expected number of trials (seed plantings) to get one successful outcome (a new type of flower).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof of Correctness**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The correctness of this solution is based on the principles of expected value in probability theory. The expected number of trials to get a success in a Bernoulli process (a process with only two outcomes, like flipping a coin) is `1/p`, where `p` is the probability of success. In our case, the probability of success changes with each new type of flower we get because the probability of getting a new type decreases as we collect more types.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For the first flower, the probability of success is `1` (since any flower will be a new type). For the second type of flower, the probability of success is `1 - 1/k` (since there's only one type we already have, and `k - 1` types we don't have). This pattern continues, decreasing the probability of getting a new type with each additional type collected.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Adding these probabilities gives us the expected total number of seeds to plant to collect all `k` types. This approach is a standard method to solve the Coupon Collector's Problem and is well-supported in probability theory."

    "**Sample Output:**  \n",
    "\"The given state is not an energy minimum, as small perturbations can lead to a different state. This instability affects the network's pattern storage and retrieval capabilities.\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints**  \n",
    "- The neurons' states should be binary or bipolar (i.e., 1 and -1).\n",
    "- The weight matrix should be symmetric, i.e., \\( w_{ij} = w_{ji} \\), to reflect the undirected nature of the network.\n",
    "- The diagonal elements of the weight matrix (self-connections) should be zero.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**  \n",
    "To address the question about the criteria for a state to be an \"energy minimum\" in a Hopfield Neural Network and its relation to the network's ability to store and retrieve patterns, we need to delve into the theoretical aspects of Hopfield Networks and the concept of energy in such systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Energy in Hopfield Networks:** The energy of a state in a Hopfield Network is given by the formula:\n",
    "   \\[ E = -\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i \\neq j} w_{ij} s_i s_j \\]\n",
    "   Here, \\( s_i \\) and \\( s_j \\) are the states of neurons \\( i \\) and \\( j \\), respectively, and \\( w_{ij} \\) is the weight of the connection between these neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Energy Minimum Criteria:**\n",
    "   - A state is at an energy minimum if any small change to the state would increase the network's energy.\n",
    "   - Mathematically, for a state to be an energy minimum, flipping the state of any single neuron should not decrease the total energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Relation to Pattern Storage and Retrieval:**\n",
    "   - Hopfield Networks store patterns as energy minima. These are stable states which the network can converge to from various initial states.\n",
    "   - When the network is given a state that is close to one of these stored patterns (minima), it will evolve to the pattern, effectively retrieving it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Calculation**  \n",
    "Consider a Hopfield Network with a state `[1, -1, 1, -1]` and a weight matrix:  \n",
    "\n",
    "[[0, 1, -1, 1],  \n",
    " [1, 0, 1, -1],  \n",

    " [1, -1, 1, 0]]  \n",
    "  \n",
    "- Calculate the energy of this state.  \n",
    "- Flip each neuron's state and calculate the new energy to see if the original state is an energy minimum.  \n",
    "If flipping any neuron results in a higher energy state, the original state is at an energy minimum and represents a stable pattern that the network can store and recall.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof of Correctness**  \n",
    "The correctness of this approach is based on the fundamental dynamics of Hopfield Networks. By definition, these networks tend to evolve towards states of lower energy. Therefore, an energy minimum state is inherently stable since any small change increases energy, causing the network to revert to the original state. This stability is what allows Hopfield Networks to recall patterns: given an input close to a stored pattern (an energy minimum), the network will evolve to the pattern, thereby retrieving it.  \n",
    "This solution offers a theoretical understanding of how energy minima in Hopfield Networks relate to their pattern storage and retrieval capabilities. For a practical implementation, one would need to simulate a Hopfield Network and observe its dynamics with different inputs and weight configurations.  \n",
    " \n",
    "**Reflection:** Reflecting on my experience with the Hopfield Neural Network task, I found ChatGPT's assistance crucial in reshaping the original question. Its ability to understand and adapt the underlying concepts of Hopfield Networks into a new, yet related question demonstrated the importance of deep subject knowledge in problem design. This step highlighted the complexity involved in crafting conceptually similar yet distinct questions.  \n",
    "The next challenge was to provide a clear solution, where ChatGPT's theoretical input was pivotal. However, translating these theories into a comprehensible explanation required a delicate balance of technical accuracy and clarity. This phase underscored the tool's role as a guide, emphasizing the need for my own deep understanding to articulate the solution fully.  \n",
    "Overall, this task enlightened me on problem design in algorithms, teaching me the essence of a problem lies in its core concepts. ChatGPT proved to be an insightful facilitator, but it also reinforced that such tools are supplements to, not replacements for, human intellect and creativity, especially in nuanced and complex topics."

    "To solve the problem of finding the expected number of flips required to get two consecutive heads with a coin that lands on heads with probability \\( q \\) and tails with probability \\( 1-q \\), we can use the concept of expected value in probability theory.  \n",

    "     - Tails with probability \\( 1-q \\), after which we are back to our original state.\n",
    "   - The expected number of flips in this stage is \\( E_2 = 1*q + (1 + E)*(1-q) \\). The term \\( 1+E \\) accounts for the flip that just happened (either heads or tails) and the expected number of additional flips needed (i.e., \\( E \\)).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Total Expected Number of Flips \\( E \\):**\n",
    "   - Combining the two stages, we have \\( E = E_1 + E_2 \\).\n",
    "   - Substituting \\( E_1 \\) and \\( E_2 \\) gives \\( E = 1/q + 1*q + (1 + E)*(1-q) \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Solving for \\( E \\):**\n",
    "   - Rearranging the equation and solving for \\( E \\) gives the final expression for the expected number of flips.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The solution involves calculating the probabilities of various outcomes when rolling two dice successively. Here's a breakdown of each part:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Event (a): First Die Shows a Six, but the Second Does Not\n",

    "- The probability of not rolling a six on the second die is \\( \\frac{5}{6} \\).\n",

    "- The probability of not rolling an even number on both dice is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n",
    "- To find the probability of at least one die showing an even number, subtract the above probability from 1 (complement rule): \\( 1 - \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Event (c): The Dice Show Different Numbers\n",
    "- The probability that both dice show the same number is \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) since there are six possible pairs where both dice are the same.\n",
    "- The probability of rolling different numbers on both dice is the complement of the above: \\( 1 - \\frac{1}{6} \\).\n",

    "#### Event (d): No More Than One Die Shows a Number Less Than Three\n",
    "- There are two outcomes to consider here:\n",
    "  - Both dice show a number less than three.\n",
    "  - One die shows a number less than three, and the other does not.\n",
    "- The probability of rolling a number less than three on a die is \\( \\frac{2}{6} \\) or \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n",
    "- The probability of rolling a number less than three on both dice is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n",

    "The Python code executes these calculations, which are straightforward applications of the basic probability principles and the independence of the dice rolls. The solution uses the complement rule effectively, especially for events where it's easier to calculate the probability of the opposite outcome and then subtract from one to get the desired probability."

    "**Solution:**  \n",
    "To address the reformulated question on Las Vegas and Monte Carlo algorithms, let's analyze each part of the question based on algorithmic theory and principles.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Part A:** Modifying a Las Vegas Algorithm to Have Bounded Runtime  \n",
    "1. **Las Vegas Algorithms:** These are randomized algorithms that always produce the correct result or report failure. They have variable runtime, but the result, when they terminate, is always correct.  \n",
    "2. **Bounded Runtime Adaptation:**  \n",
    "   - To modify a Las Vegas algorithm to have a bounded runtime, one could introduce a limit on the number of iterations or the total execution time.\n",
    "   - If the algorithm reaches this limit without finding a solution, it could either return a failure or the best solution found within the constraint.  \n",
    "3. **Impact on Probabilistic Correctness:**  \n",
    "   - By bounding the runtime, we are essentially introducing a trade-off between runtime and the probability of finding the correct solution.\n",
    "   - The algorithm may still maintain a high probability of correctness but won't guarantee it in every execution, as it might terminate prematurely due to the bound.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Part B:** Transforming a Monte Carlo Algorithm to Guarantee an Exact Solution  \n",
    "1. **Monte Carlo Algorithms:** These algorithms have a bounded runtime but may only produce a correct result with some probability. They are typically used for problems where an approximate solution is acceptable.  \n",
    "2. **Guaranteeing Exact Solution:**  \n",
    "   - To modify a Monte Carlo algorithm to guarantee an exact solution, one would need to alter its probabilistic components to ensure correctness.\n",
    "   - This could involve increasing the sample size, iterating until a certain confidence level is achieved, or employing a hybrid approach with deterministic methods.\n",
    "3. **Impact on Performance Characteristics:**  \n",
    "   - Such modifications would likely impact the algorithm’s performance, potentially increasing its runtime or computational complexity.\n",
    "   - The challenge is to retain the original performance characteristics while enhancing accuracy, which may not always be feasible, especially for complex or NP-hard problems.\n",

    "- **Output:** The estimated median of the dataset and its confidence interval.\n",

    "- **Input:** Dataset: [35, 21, 47, 19, 13, 53, 29], Sample size: 3\n",
    "- **Output:** Estimated median: 29, Confidence interval: (21, 37)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints:\n",
    "- The dataset contains a large number of integers.\n",
    "- The sample is chosen uniformly at random without replacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**  \n",
    "When selecting an approximate median from a large dataset using random sampling, the goal is to estimate the median value that would split the dataset into two halves. This method is particularly useful when sorting or partitioning large datasets, as in quicksort, where a good pivot can significantly affect the algorithm's efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Process Overview:**\n",
    "1. Randomly sample a subset of the dataset.\n",
    "2. Calculate the median of this sample.\n",
    "3. Use this sample median as an estimate for the overall median.\n",
    "4. Determine the confidence interval around the sample median to understand the estimate's accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statistical Basis:**\n",
    "- The median of a sample can be used as a point estimate of the population median.\n",
    "- The standard error of the median can be approximated by dividing the sample's standard deviation by the square root of the sample size.\n",
    "- A confidence interval can then be constructed around the sample median to give a range within which the true median is likely to lie, given a confidence level.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Computing Confidence Interval:**\n",
    "- The standard deviation is a measure of the dispersion of the sample. The larger it is, the wider the confidence interval will be, indicating less certainty in the estimate.\n",
    "- The confidence level (usually 95%) tells us how confident we can be that the interval contains the true median.\n",
    "- The confidence interval is calculated using the t-distribution, which is more appropriate than the normal distribution when dealing with small sample sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python Implementation:**\n",
    "The provided Python code performs these steps using numpy for sampling and calculations and scipy.stats for confidence interval calculation. It uses the t-distribution to calculate the interval, which adjusts for smaller sample sizes. The `ddof=1` argument in the standard deviation calculation ensures that we use the sample standard deviation, which is a slightly biased estimator with a higher degree of freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method of median estimation is not guaranteed to be perfectly accurate, especially with very small samples or non-uniform distributions, but it can provide a reasonable approximation quickly and with low computational overhead, which is particularly useful in algorithms like quicksort where such an estimate is sufficient."

    "  - (D) The chance that a shard gets less than `1/k` times the average load.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Inputs and Outputs:\n",
    "- **Input:** `r = 1000` read requests, `s = 10` shards\n",

    "  - (C) Probability shard load ≥ 2× average: Y%\n",
    "  - (D) Probability shard load < 50% average: Z%\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints:\n",
    "- Each read request is independently assigned to a shard.\n",
    "- `r` and `s` are positive integers, with `r` typically larger than `s`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**  \n",
    "In the context of a distributed database system, the task is to analyze how `r` read requests are distributed across `s` database shards when each request is randomly assigned to a shard. This is a typical load balancing problem where the goal is to ensure that no shard is overloaded or underutilized.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Detailed Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part A: Expected Number of Read Requests Per Shard\n",
    "- **Expected Requests Per Shard:**\n",
    "  - Since each of the `r` read requests is equally likely to go to any of the `s` shards, the expected number of requests per shard is the total number of requests divided by the number of shards, i.e., `r / s`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part B: Likelihood of Shard Load Above 120% of Average\n",
    "- **Calculating High Load Probability:**\n",
    "  - The binomial distribution is used because each read request can be considered a Bernoulli trial with two outcomes: it either goes to a specific shard (success) or it doesn't (failure).\n",
    "  - The probability of a shard having more than 120% of the average load is computed by finding the cumulative probability of the shard having up to 120% load and subtracting from 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part C: Probability of Shard Receiving at Least `k` Times the Average Load\n",
    "- **Determining Load `k` Times Above Average:**\n",
    "  - Using the same binomial distribution, the probability is calculated for a shard receiving at least `k` times the average number of read requests. This is found by summing the probabilities of getting `k` times the average load to the total number of requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part D: Chance of Shard Getting Less Than `1/k` Times Average Load\n",
    "- **Estimating Low Load Probability:**\n",
    "  - Conversely, the probability of a shard receiving less than `1/k` times the average load is found by calculating the cumulative distribution up to `1/k` times the average load.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python Implementation:**\n",
    "The Python code uses the `binom` class from the `scipy.stats` module to calculate the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for binomial probabilities. This is a powerful feature of `scipy` that allows for quick and accurate computation of probabilities over a range of values in a binomial distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions and Constraints:**\n",
    "- The model assumes that read requests are independent of each other, meaning the assignment of one request does not affect the assignment of another.\n",
    "- It is also assumed that `r` is typically larger than `s`, which is common in distributed systems where the number of tasks often exceeds the number of processors or shards.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis is particularly useful for understanding the performance and reliability of distributed systems. It helps in designing load balancers by providing a statistical understanding of how evenly distributed the load might be and allows for planning capacity and scaling strategies."

    "**Reflection:** In crafting this new problem based on load balancing in a server cluster, I leveraged the concept of random assignment from ChatGPT to a distributed database context. The challenge was to adapt the problem to a different domain while maintaining the probabilistic nature of the load distribution. The task taught me the broad applicability of these principles across different computational systems. Writing the Python code required careful consideration of statistical methods, particularly the binomial distribution, to model the random distribution of tasks. ChatGPT's suggestions were invaluable in ensuring that the solution was not only algorithmically sound but also grounded in practical scenarios. This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the underlying principles when designing algorithmic problems, highlighting how tools like ChatGPT can complement and enhance the learning process."

    "**Problem Statement**\n",
    "Given a graph with weighted edges, apply a simulated annealing algorithm to find a configuration that minimizes the total edge weight for a given set of nodes. The goal is to determine the set of nodes that, when connected, result in the lowest possible sum of weights, representing a stable and efficient network configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input and Output Format:\n",
    "- **Input:** A list of tuples representing the weighted edges of the graph, where each tuple is formatted as (node1, node2, weight).\n",
    "- **Output:** A set of nodes representing the stable configuration and the total minimized weight of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Inputs and Outputs:\n",
    "- **Input:** Graph edges with weights: [(1, 2, -5), (2, 3, 6), (3, 1, 9), (1, 4, 5), (2, 4, -3), (3, 4, 1)]\n",
    "- **Output:** Stable configuration: {1, 2, 4}, Total weight: -7\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints:\n",
    "- The graph is undirected and may have negative weight edges.\n",
    "- The algorithm should aim to find a subset of nodes such that the sum of the connecting edge weights is minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**  \n",
    "The solution to Q3 involves a problem that mimics the Hopfield Neural Network's state-flipping algorithm but is adapted to the context of finding a stable and efficient configuration in a network using simulated annealing. Here's an explanation of the solution approach and the Python code provided:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simulated Annealing Approach:**\n",
    "1. **Initialization:** \n",
    "   - Begin with a randomly selected subset of edges from the graph as the current solution and calculate its total weight.\n",
    "   - Set an initial \"temperature\" that will gradually decrease, representing the \"cooling\" of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iteration and State Transition:**\n",
    "   - At each step, slightly modify the current solution by swapping edges—remove a random edge from the current solution and add another edge not currently in the solution.\n",
    "   - Calculate the new total weight after this swap to see if the solution improves.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Acceptance Criteria:**\n",
    "   - If the new solution has a lower total weight (better solution), accept it as the new current solution.\n",
    "   - If the new solution is worse, it can still be accepted with a probability that decreases with the temperature and depends on how much worse the new solution is compared to the current one. This probability is given by the Boltzmann distribution: \\( e^{\\frac{-\\Delta E}{T}} \\), where \\( \\Delta E \\) is the change in total weight and \\( T \\) is the current temperature.\n",
    "   - This criterion allows the algorithm to escape local minima in the search for a global minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Cooling Schedule:**\n",
    "   - The temperature is reduced by a factor (cooling rate) at each step. This gradually reduces the probability of accepting worse solutions and allows the algorithm to \"settle\" into a minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Termination:**\n",
    "   - The algorithm continues iterating and \"cooling\" until the temperature reaches a lower threshold, at which point it is assumed to be sufficiently close to a minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Result:**\n",
    "   - The final stable configuration is derived from the set of nodes connected by the edges in the final solution. The total minimized weight is also reported.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python Code Description:**\n",
    "The provided code simulates the described simulated annealing process. It starts with a random subset of edges, iteratively swaps edges in and out, and uses a cooling schedule to determine if the new set of edges should be accepted. The final output includes the set of nodes that form the stable configuration and the corresponding total weight of the selected edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution applies the principles of simulated annealing, which is inspired by the physical process of cooling metal, to an optimization problem in graph theory. It demonstrates how a global minimum can be approached using probabilistic transitions, even when the search space is complex and has many local minima. This approach is particularly useful for NP-hard problems where finding the exact global minimum is computationally infeasible."
